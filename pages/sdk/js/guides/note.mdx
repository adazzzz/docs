# Note

A character can create notes.

A note is typically an article published on the blockchain.

## Create a Note

Assume that we have a character named `Alice` with character ID `42`. Alice wants create a note as a blog post:

```ts
contract.postNote(
  42, // character ID
  "https://example.com/note.json", // note metadata URL
);
```

Please refer to [`postNote`](/sdk/js/contract/note/create-note#postnote) for more details.

### Note Metadata

The `https://example.com/note.json` above is the URL of the note metadata. The note is a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Hello World",
  "content": "This is a note."
}
```

It can be hosted on any web server. It can be `ipfs://` URL. For example, here is another more complex note metadata: [`ipfs://bafkreidhjuuo2vibtevn66v2q6bjq652sfox6csocg6v2adwhywifcnzcy`](https://ipfs.4everland.xyz/ipfs/bafkreidhjuuo2vibtevn66v2q6bjq652sfox6csocg6v2adwhywifcnzcy).

You can create a note with metadata content object directly:

```ts
contract.postNote(
  42, // character ID
  {
    title: "Hello World",
    content: "This is a note."
  }
);
```

In this case, the SDK will automatically upload the metadata to IPFS and create a `ipfs://` URL for you.

Please refer to [Note Metadata](/docs/specs/metadata/note-metadata) for more details.

### Link and Unlink a Note

You can use [link](/sdk/js/guides/link) to link a note to another note.

For example, a character `42` likes the note `5` written by another character `43`:

```ts
// character ID 42 likes note ID 43-5 (the 5th note of character 43)
const { data } = await contract.linkNote(42, 43, 5, 'like')
console.log(data) // linklist ID

// character ID 42 unlikes note ID 43-5
await contract.unlinkNote(42, 43, 5, 'like')
```

Please refer to [Link Topics - Like and Unlike a Note](/sdk/js/guides/link#derived-case-like-and-unlike-a-note) for more details.

### Note Link/Mint Module

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout>
  Before attaching a link or a module to a note, please refer to the [Concepts - Mint/Link Module](/docs/concepts/link-mint-module) section to learn more about what a module is.
</Callout>

Please refer to the [`linkModule` options API](/sdk/js/contract/note/create-note#optionslinkmodule-optional) and [`mintModule` options API](/sdk/js/contract/note/create-note#optionsmintmodule-optional) for more details.

### Mint a Note

After creating a note, everyone (wallets) can mint it.

For example, to mint a note with characterId `42` and noteId `5` to the address `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890`:

```ts
const { data } = await contract.mintNote(
  42, // characterId
  5, // noteId
  '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890', // toAddress
)
```

Now, the address `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890` owns the note NFT with contract address `0xabc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc1` and token ID `6` (meaning that the note NFT is stored at the contract of address `0xabc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc1`, and the minter is the 6th to mint).

This minted note NFT is of ERC721 type. It can be transferred to another address, or burned.

<Callout>
  It deserves to be noted that minting might fail if the note is attached with a mint module that limits who can mint it. The app should handle this case.
</Callout>

Please refer to [`mintNote`](/sdk/js/contract/note/mint-note#mintnote) for more details.

### Query Notes

You can query the notes from the indexer.

For example, to query the notes of character `42`:

```ts
const { list } = await indexer.getNotes({
  characterId: 42,
});
```

## Topics

### Reply to a Note

#### Reply

A character can reply to a note. This is done by using the [`contract.postNoteForNote`](/sdk/js/contract/note/create-note#postnotefornote) method:

```ts
// character ID 42 replies to note ID 43-5 (the 5th note of character 43)
const result = contract.postNoteForNote(
  42, // character ID
  { content: "Thank you!" }, // note metadata
  43, // target character ID
  5, // target note ID
);
console.log(result) // The note ID of the reply, e.g. 1
```

To query all the replies of the note `43-5`:

```ts
const { list } = await indexer.getNotes({
  toCharacterId: 43,
  toNoteId: 5,
});
console.log(list) // The list of notes that reply to note 43-5, which includes the note 42-1
```

#### Reply to a Reply (Thread)

Of course, the character `43` can also reply to the reply:

```ts
// character ID 43 replies to note ID 42-6 (the 6th note of character 42)
contract.postNoteForNote(
  43, // character ID
  { content: "You're welcome!" }, // note metadata
  42, // target character ID
  1, // target note ID
);
```

This becomes a tree structure of notes:

```text
43-5
└── 42-1
    └── 43-6
```

This is commonly called a "note thread". In real-world applications, the thread might be more complex:

```text
43-5
├── 42-1
│   ├── 43-6
│   └── 42-2
│       └── 43-7
└── 42-3
    └── 43-8
```

We can query the whole thread recursively:

```ts
async function getNoteThread(
  characterId: number,
  noteId: number,
  depth: number = 0,
): Promise<Note[]> {
  const { list } = await indexer.getNotes({
    toCharacterId: characterId,
    toNoteId: noteId,
  });

  if (depth === 0) {
    return list;
  }

  const replies = await Promise.all(
    list.map((note) =>
      getNoteThread(note.characterId, note.noteId, depth - 1),
    ),
  );

  return list.concat(...replies);
}
```

Or using the `includeNestedNotes` parameter to fetch them in one query (recommended):

```ts
const { list } = await indexer.getNotes({
  toCharacterId: 43,
  toNoteId: 5,
  includeNestedNotes: true,
  nestedNotesDepth: 3, // 3 levels of replies, max is 3 for performance
  nestedNotesLimit: 10, // 10 replies per level
});
```

### Note Variant: "Achievement"

#### Publish an Achievement Note

A character can post a note as an achievement for others to mint.

This is done by setting the `"variant"` field in the [note metadata](/docs/specs/metadata/note-metadata) to `"achievement"`. For example:

```json {2}
{
  "variant": "achievement",
  "title": "Sponsor NFT",
  "content": "This is a sponsor NFT for my fans.",
  "attachments": [
    {
      "mime_type": "image/png",
      "address": "ipfs://example/sponsor_nft.png"
    }
  ],
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Tier",
      "value": "Gold",
      "display_type": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

```ts
contract.postNote(
  42, // character ID
  "https://example.com/my-sponsor-nft.json", // note metadata URL
);
```

This note is not technically special; it just has a `"variant"` field to indicate that it is an achievement NFT, and should be **displayed** as such in Apps.

#### Query Achievement Notes

##### Query Achievement Notes Published by a Character

You can query with the `variant` field in `indexer.getNotes` to get the list of achievement notes published by a character

```ts
const { list } = await indexer.getNotes({
  characterId: 42,
  variant: "achievement",
});
```

##### Query Achievement Notes Minted by an Address

You can query with the `variant` field in `indexer.getMintedNotesOfAddress` to get the list of achievement notes minted by an address

```ts
const { list } = await indexer.getMintedNotesOfAddress(
  "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
  { variant: "achievement" },
);
```

#### Attach Mint Module

Just as other notes, an achievement note can be attached with a mint module.

One useful example is to limit the group of people who can mint the achievement note. In this case, `ApproveMintModule` can be used.

```ts
contract.postNote(
  42, // character ID
  "https://example.com/my-sponsor-nft.json", // note metadata URL
  {
    mintModule: {
      address: "0x328610484ba1fAAE0fCDEe44990D199cD84c8608",
      data: [
        ['0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890', '0xabc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc1'],
        1,
      ]
    },
  }
);
```

The above code will attach a `ApproveMintModule` to the achievement note, which means that only these two addresses can mint the achievement note, and each address can mint it only once (`1`).

### Restrict Minting

#### Approve Mint Module

##### Attach Approve Mint Module

As we have seen in the previous section, you can attach the mint module `ApproveMintModule` to a note to restrict who can mint it.

```ts
contract.postNote(
  42, // character ID
  "https://example.com/my-sponsor-nft.json", // note metadata URL
  {
    mintModule: {
      address: "0x328610484ba1fAAE0fCDEe44990D199cD84c8608",
      data: [
        ['0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890', '0xabc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc1'],
        1,
      ]
    },
  }
);
```

In this example, only addresses `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890` and `0xabc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc1` can mint the note, and each address can mint it only once (`1`). This is called `initData`.

##### Query Approve Mint Module

How do we recover the mint module information from a note? Here is an example.

For example, the above code posted a note `42-5` (Character ID: `42`, Note Id: `5`), you can query the mint module attached with `indexer.getMintModules`:

```ts
const { list } = await indexer.getMintModules({
  toCharacterId: 42,
  toNoteId: 5,
});
const mintModule = list[0]; // there should be only one mint module for the specified note
console.log(mintModule);
```

The result will look like this:

```json {5}
{
  "targetItemType": "Note",
  "linkValue": "42-5",
  "contractAddress": "0x328610484ba1faae0fcdee44990d199cd84c8608",
  "initData": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000040000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000001234567890123456789012345678901234567890000000000000000000000000abc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc1",
  "returnData": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000040000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000001234567890123456789012345678901234567890000000000000000000000000abc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc1",
  "toCharacterId": 45,
  "toNoteId": 188,
  "operator": "0xc560eb6fd0c2eb80df50e5e06715295ae1205049",
  "createdAt": "2023-03-30T16:26:10.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2023-03-30T16:26:10.000Z",
  "deletedAt": null,
  "transactionHash": "0x5ea8d21d8c6edd5ed5f37a00ac5fc31b536d8befec12d592b9e4bda8e8445a15",
  "blockNumber": 29834475,
  "logIndex": 1,
  "updatedTransactionHash": "0x5ea8d21d8c6edd5ed5f37a00ac5fc31b536d8befec12d592b9e4bda8e8445a15",
  "updatedBlockNumber": 29834475,
  "updatedLogIndex": 1
}
```

`initData` is the encoded init data string we passed in the previous section. We can decode it with `contract.decodeModuleInitData`:

```ts
const decodedInitData = await contract.decodeModuleInitData(
  '0x328610484ba1faae0fcdee44990d199cd84c8608',
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000040000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000001234567890123456789012345678901234567890000000000000000000000000abc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc1',
);
console.log(decodedInitData);
```

The result will look like this:

```ts
[
  [
    '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890',
    '0xAbc123def456aBc123def456aBc123DEf456ABc1'
  ],
  BigNumber { _hex: '0x01', _isBigNumber: true }
]
```

which is the same as the `initData` we passed in the previous section. Please note that the addresses are in formatted mixed-case (aka. a Checksum Address), and the number `1` is a `BigNumber`. You can convert it to a number with `toNumber()`.
